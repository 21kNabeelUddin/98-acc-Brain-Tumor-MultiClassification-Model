# Brain Tumor MRI Classification

This project is focused on classifying brain tumor images using a deep learning model. The dataset used for this project is the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, which consists of four classes: Pituitary, No Tumor, Meningioma, and Glioma. The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has one of these four types of brain tumors based on MRI scan images.

## Credits

This dataset was made available by Tom Beckert on Kaggle. A big thanks to him for providing this dataset and enabling us to explore and build a machine learning model for this important problem.

Dataset Description
The Brain Tumor MRI Dataset contains images of brain MRI scans categorized into four types of tumors:

Pituitary

No Tumor

Meningioma 

Glioma 

## 1. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

Resizing: All images were resized to 299x299 pixels to match the input size required by the Xception model.
Data Augmentation: To increase dataset diversity and prevent overfitting, several augmentation techniques were applied:
Rotation: Images were rotated by up to 30 degrees.
Shifting: Images were shifted horizontally and vertically by 20%.
Zooming: Zoomed in on images by 20%.
Shearing: Applied slight image shearing.
Horizontal Flip: Randomly flipped images horizontally.
Reason: Augmentation helps the model generalize better, improving performance on new data and reducing overfitting.

## 2. Model Architecture

Base Model: The Xception model, pre-trained on ImageNet, was used as a feature extractor for better performance.
Pooling: Combined Global Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling for better feature extraction.
Custom Layers:
Dropout: Added to reduce overfitting.
Batch Normalization: Used to speed up training.
L2 Regularization: Applied to help generalize the model.
Reason: Xception is a powerful model for image classification, and using pre-trained weights improves accuracy.

## 3. Model Training

Learning Rate Scheduling: Gradually reduced the learning rate to improve convergence.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer was used to adjust model weights during training.
Callbacks:
Early Stopping: Stopped training early if validation loss stopped improving.
Model Checkpointing: Saved the best model weights for later use.
Reason: Learning rate scheduling helps the model converge better, and callbacks prevent overfitting while saving the best model.

## 4. Model Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, and Recall were used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
Confusion Matrix: Used to visualize the model's predictions.
Reason: These metrics give a more complete view of model performance, especially for rare classes in medical images.

## 5. Testing and Final Evaluation

The best model, saved during training, was used to evaluate the test dataset and compared with the validation results to check generalization.
